Pyth Prize Justification

I used Pyth’s Entropy SDK to generate trustless, verifiable randomness for apple spawning in BeSnake. Since each game’s outcome directly affects real money (players stake ETH), we needed randomness that couldn’t be predicted, manipulated, or biased by either player. Pyth gave us on-chain, tamper-proof entropy so every apple spawn is provably fair, making gameplay transparent and preventing any RNG-based exploits.
