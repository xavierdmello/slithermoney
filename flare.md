Flare

We integrated Flare’s randomness as a secondary RNG source to harden our game logic. Competitive staked gameplay needs redundancy—if the RNG fails or is compromised, the entire match becomes unfair. Flare allowed us to add another independent randomness layer, increasing trust in the fairness of apple generation and strengthening our overall security model.
